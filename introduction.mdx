| Feature                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Gaze Controlled                | Users communicate entirely through gaze (where the user is looking). Using a camera, the system detects specific eye gestures, like looking up, down, left, or right, to select responses or actions.                                                             |
| AI Powered Response Generation | Visio utilizes fine-tuned LLMs and a built in memory to generate contextually and semantically relevant answers based on a question. This eliminates the need for patients to navigate through multiple pages of options, before being able to select a response. |
| Realistic Sounding Voices      | Patients can choose to speak using synthesized male or female voices or use their own cloned version of their own voice, created with previously recorded audio files.                                                                                            |
| Mental Health Check-ins        | Visio’s system includes an automated mental health check-in feature that determines the well-being of the user and provides emergency alerts to caregivers when necessary.                                                                                        |
